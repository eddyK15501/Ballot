Ballot/test/Ballot-test.js


Ballot.sol is a sample contract on remix.ethereum.org. Made a few minor tweeks by making the function winningProposal private, as well as adding a modifier to make sure that the winnerName function can only be called by the chairman. Used this smart contract for the purpose of testing with ethers.js. 

Compiled and deployed using localhost and rinkeby network.
